# 08_databricks_mlops — Databricks and Scalable ML Pipelines

This module focuses on developing and deploying machine learning workflows in **Databricks** — a cloud-based platform integrating **Apache Spark**, **Delta Lake**, and **MLflow**.  
The goal is to bridge the gap between traditional local ML development and large-scale, production-grade data and model pipelines.
